This is the 2nd 3d printer that Ohmbase uses.  We've had it since around late 2013?

The design of Mix G1 is based on Wallace. The main advantage is the mechanical structure, which is easy to understand, build, and does not need much calibration . Mix G1 has one of the smallest nozzle size(0.34mm) that results great printing quality once you have it running. The printing speed can go up to 150mm/s for infill, and the layer hight is as thin as 0.17mm(can't even see the layers).
